# Bevy Ball Game

A simple 2D game built with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), Rustâ€™s game engine.

This project is based on the [Bevy Ball Game tutorial](https://github.com/frederickjjoubert/bevy-ball-game) by [frederickjjoubert](https://github.com/frederickjjoubert). It serves as both a learning exercise and a foundation for future experimentation with Bevy.

## What's different?

- Upgraded to Bevy **0.16.1**
- Simplified the project structure by reducing the number of files
- Adapted the original codebase to better match my own learning style and preferences

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
